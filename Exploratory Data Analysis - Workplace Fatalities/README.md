<h1 align='center'>Exploratory Data Anlysis - Workplace Fatalities</h1>

### Executive Summary:
Using data that shows workplace fatalities (and injuries) by state in the year 2012, I conducted an exploratory data analysis project uses Excel. The primary goal of the project was to create a dashboard that highlights one important aspect of the data and allows the reader to intereact with other aspects of the data. To complete this goal, the visualization contains descriptive statistics, a pivot table with a slicer, and utilizes data storytelling techniques. The report answers the following questions:
  1. Which program, state or federal, has the highest rate of fatalities?
     - Federal programs have the highest rate of fatalities at a rate of 128.2 versus the 87.7 found with state programs.
  2. Which state with a state program has the highest number of injuries/illnesses?
     - California has the highest number of injuries/illnesses.
  3. What is the relationship, if any, between “Average of Years to Inspect Each Workplace Once” and “Rate of Fatalities”?
     - There is a slight positive correlation between the “Average of Years to Inspect Each Workplace Once” and “Rate of Fatalities”.
  4. Is there was a relationship between the average number of years it takes to do one inspection and the number of inspectors in each state?
     - The number of inspectors does not have an impact on the average amount of inspection years.
  5. Does the average inspection years have an impact on injury and fatality rates?
     - The amount of time it takes to inspect one workplace does have a small impact, with the longer it takes occasionally resulting in higher reported rates of injuries/illnesses and fatalities.

### Business Problem:
It's important to assess the safety of workplaces across the country. Using data from 2012, I needed to see which program has the highest rate of fatalities (state or federal), which state with a state program has the highest number of fatalities, and if there is a relationship between the average amount of years to inspect a worplace and the rate of fatalities within said workplace. On top of the questions, I wanted to know if there was a relationship between the number of inspectors in a state and the amount of time it takes to inspect a workplace, and if the avergae amount of inspection years have an impact on injury and fatality rates.

### Methodology:
Using Excel to:
1. Highlight at least one interesting aspect of the data
2. Allow a reader to interactively explore other aspects of the data
